## Bind method
`In early JavaScript there were many problems for injecting new methods like 
    buttonClick and also in early React the onclick method of buttonHandler() doesn't work
    properly and not show any response for working. But, the .bind() in JS used for bind object
    properties to another objects and methods for adequate accessing of methods variables 
    and many more so, this method evolutionary evolved.
